*Accurate time synchronization in low-energy, microcontroller based embedded systems is right here with the flexPTP library on our side.*

![flexPTP-running-on-TM4C1294](manual/media/TIVA.gif)

**flexPTP has been designed with low resource utilization in mind. The library can easily fit into 20K program and 10K data memory space with all features enabled. The library has been ported to and tested on ARM Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 based microcontrollers manufactured by several vendors (e.g. STM32F4xx, STM32F7xx, STM32H7xx, TM4C1294 etc.). According to simple measurements published in several papers of ours, with the help of the library even low-power systems achieved a synchronization precision of tens of nanoseconds.**

*The library is released under the MIT license with the endeavour to provide quick and compact solution for embedded time synchronization.*

## Features

flexPTP offers the following capabilities:

- [IEEE 1588](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9120376) compatible **slave** and **master** OC implementation
- supports **E2E** and **P2P** delay mechanisms
- supports **L2** and **L4** transport mechanisms
- supports **one-step** and **two-step** signaling modes

## Requirements

Apart from the access to a working C compiler, only the following two criteria must be met to compile flexPTP:

- The library relies on the services of the [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) embedded operating system thus it is required to integrate the library.
- A compatible network stack library and target platform Ethernet driver is required. Currently [Lightweight IP](https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip) (lwip) and [EtherLib](https://gitea.epagris.com/epagris/EtherLib) are supported.

## Porting and options

For elaborate information on porting and options refer to [Porting and configuration](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/porting.html).

### Network stack requirements

The network stack (lwIP or EtherLib) must provide tools to communicate receive and transmit timestamps along the PTP messages. It's the developers responsibility to make the timestamps captured in the hardware available to the flexPTP module.

For better understading how timestamps are fed into flexPTP, refer to [ptp_receive_enqueue()](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/task__ptp_8c.html#a73b5e9841da53dee4d9230d8a418b2ac) in [task_ptp.c](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/task__ptp_8c.html).

#### lwIP

The lwIP (up to v2.2.0) is not designed for support timestamp propagation right away. A possible workaround is the extension of the `pbuf` structure so that it can carry the timestamps and the usual packet data as well through defining the `LWIP_PBUF_CUSTOM_DATA` macro.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{c}
// Main packet buffer struct
struct pbuf {
  /* ... */

  // Contents of LWIP_PBUF_CUSTOM_DATA>>
  /* PTP timestamp fields */
  u32_t time_s, time_ns;

  /* Transmit callback function */
  void (*tx_cb)(struct pbuf * pPbuf);
  // <<Contents of LWIP_PBUF_CUSTOM_DATA
};
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The low level lwIP-Ethernet driver must be instrumented to communicate receive and transmit timestamps. Fortunately, developing such an extension is not that difficult, at all. As an example you can find a guide [here](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/_h743_ethernetif_modifications.html) that showcases our amendments to the vendor-provided `ethernetif.c` low level lwIP Ethernet driver file for the STM32H743 platform. You can also find examples on PTP-compatible lwip low-level drivers among the [example projects](#platforms-and-examples).

#### EtherLib

EtherLib provides immediate support for passing timestamp with packet data. For more information, visit the [EtherLib repository](https://gitea.epagris.com/epagris/EtherLib).


### Compile-time options

The flexPTP library expects hardware constants and parameters as well as default settings passed in a `flexptp_options.h` header file.

## Building

The preferred and encouraged way to compile the library is to harness the built-in CMake support, although, building using any IDE is possible. The only requirement is a working a C (cross-)compiler (e.g. `arm-none-eabi-gcc`). More, detailed description on this topic: [Compiling the library](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/building.html).

## Usage

### Startup and shutdown

The flexPTP module can be started/stopped by calling [reg_task_ptp()](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/task__ptp_8c.html#a2d483d3c32b3890d8c699018e48e45cd)/[unreg_task_ptp](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/task__ptp_8c.html#a5fd98059e4c2ec1004c74064e17cbe4c).

### Runtime operation

The library has an extensive interface for manipulating the PTP operation mode during runtime (e.g. change profile, enable logging etc.), learn more [here](https://epagris.github.io/flexPTP/project_organization.html). The flexPTP includes a CLI interface as well, if a suitable CLI library is given, flexPTP offers the following multitude of CLI commands:

```
ptp servo params [Kp Kd]                           Set or query K_p and K_d servo parameters
ptp servo log internals {on|off}                   Enable or disable logging of servo internals

```
The library can load a previously stored or save the current configuration from and to a non-volatile storage with the help of some glue code.

## Performance measurements

Our library achieves decent synchronization performance, usually **better than 100ns timing precision** even on low-power microcontrollers. The below measurements were made using the nowadays common gPTP (802.1AS) profile. Logs corresponding to each plot are located [here](manual/dumps/).
